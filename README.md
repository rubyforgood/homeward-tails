# Pet Rescue Adoption Application

The Pet Rescue app is derived from the [Baja Pet Rescue Dog Adoption Application](https://github.com/kasugaijin/baja-pet-rescue/tree/main) created by @kasugaijin who wanted to give back to the grassroots organization from where he adopted his dog in Mexico by building them a web application. Pet Rescue is an application that makes it easy to link adopters with pets.

### Local Setup

To set this application up locally:
* `rails -v` to ensure you have Rails 7.0.3 installed
* Run `rbenv versions` or `rvm list rubies` and confirm that Ruby 3.1.1 is installed
* `psql --version` to ensure you have PostgreSQL 12.12 installed (make sure you have a user and password)
* If you need more information on setting up PostgreSQL with rails, see [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-installing-postgresql)
* `git clone <'SSH Key'>` to download application locally
* `bundle install` to install gems 
* `bundle exec figaro install`
* Add your PostgreSQL database username and database password to `config/application.yml` as ENV variables e.g., `DATABASE_USERNAME: "username"` `DATABASE_PASSWORD: "password`
* `rails db:setup` to create the database, load the schema, and load seed data
* `gem install foreman` to handle processes
* `bin/dev` to run the local server
* `localhost:3000` in web browser to access the application


**Test Accounts**

Adopter
- email: `b@c.com`
- password: `123456`

Staff
- email: `a@b.com`
- password: `123456`


A user account is associated with either an adopter account or staff account. 
Staff accounts by default are `verified: false` and belong to a placeholder organization, `organization_id: 1`.
Therefore, you will need to do the following things in `rails console` before you can access the full functionality of staff. 
1) Create an organization `Organization.create(name: 'Placeholder')`
2) Create a staff account via the app UI
3) Find that user account by finding the `user_id` e.g., `User.find_by(email: 'enter email here')`
4) Set the staff account verified to true `user_id` e.g., `StaffAccount.find_by(user_id: '#').update(verified: true)`
