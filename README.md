# Pet Rescue Adoption Application

The Pet Rescue app is derived from the [Baja Pet Rescue Dog Adoption Application](https://github.com/kasugaijin/baja-pet-rescue/tree/main) created by @kasugaijin who wanted to give back to the grassroots organization from where he adopted his dog in Mexico by building them a web application. Pet Rescue is an application that makes it easy to link adopters with pets.

# üöÄ Getting Started

Let's get your machine setup to startup the application!

## Prerequisites

‚ö†Ô∏è  We assume you already have ruby installed with your preferred version manager. This codebase supports [rbenv](
https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby).

## Install & Setup

Clone the codebase 
```
git clone git@github.com:rubyforgood/pet-rescue.git
```

Create a new `config/application.yml` file from the `config/application.example.yml`:
```
cp config/application.example.yml config/application.yml
```

Update your `config/application.yml` by replacing the places that say REPLACE_ME.

Run the setup script to prepare DB and assets
```sh
bin/setup
```

To run the app locally, use:
```
bin/dev
```

You should now be able to access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
