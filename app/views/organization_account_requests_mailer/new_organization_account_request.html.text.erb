Hi Dev Team,

We’ve got a new organization request! Here are the details:

- Organization Name: <%= @organization_name %>
- Contact Name: <%= @requester_name %>
- Organization Phone Number: <%= @organization_phone %>
- Organization Email: <%= @organization_email %>
# - Country: <%= @country %>
# - City/Town: <%= @city_town %>
# - Province/State: <%= @province_state %>

This organization will need a quick review. Once vetted, let’s chat with them about their preferred slug and kick off the service to get them set up.

Thanks, everyone!
